# TimerSleepBench
Script to find the best resolution for SET TIMER RESOLUTION (WINDOWS 11 ONLY)

## Setup
Working on python. 
Maybe you'll probably need to install some requirements:

`pip install <module>`

Put the bin folder into the root of your C:\ Disk.
Like `C:\bin\setup`

## Run

To run the project, run the file `start.cmd` press `ENTER` and wait a long moment. (really)

At the end of the script, you will see the lowest average between 5100/5000.
